Notes on polyphony and midi modes...

Mono Mode:
   - CvOutput_A receives every NoteOn/Off (and all other midi messages) on its assigned channel(s)
   - same for CvOutput_B
   - CCs ("channel messages") are handled separately for each CvOutput
   - When a NoteOff is received:
      If there are any held notes, then "retrigger" behavior is applied:
       - No retrigger
       - Retrigger the highest held note
       - Retrigger the lowest held note
       - Retrigger the latest held note
	

Poly Mode:
  - The MidiController receives every NoteOn/Off
        --> on what channel(s)? On whatever channel CvOut_A is receiving on
    - A "voice allocation policy" decides which CvOutput it should forward the message to, e.g.
      - assign to least-recently used CvOutput (i.e. alternate between both)
      - assign to B if B is unused, otherwise assign it to A
        --> this is like... the first note held will always be assigned to Cv_B
                            all subsequent notes that are held down will go to Cv_A
      - ... more policies...
    - CC "channel messages" are still handled separately for each CvOutput
      - Cv_A and Cv_B receive CCs on their respective assigned midi channels
        --> this works as long as A and B are not forced to listen on same channel

      - retrigger behavior still applies
