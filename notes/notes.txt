NOTES, TODO, and IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
=======================================


############################
### CALIBRATION PROCEDURE

- Select which CV output to calibrate (or just do them in order)
- Starting at -3V and going to +7V, do the following:
	- Use CC #?? for coarse adjust
	- Use CC #?? for fine adjust
	- Press "Learn" button to save the calibration point and move to next octave
	- Adjust so that voltage at CV out is equal to one of [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, ..., 7]
	

- How does Yarns's calibration and DAC out work?

CHANNEL SELECT MODE - when enabled, the program waits for three note on events from ANY channel
	the note values correspond to midi channels:
		- C4 (i.e. middle C, note number 60) is MIDI channel 1
		- +1 semitone is +1 channel
		- D#5 is ch 16 (midi note number 75
		- if you play a note outside of this range, the default basic channel is used

############################
### Modes:

Advance/Clock Out:
- KCS (keyboard controlling sequencer)
- CCS (clock controlling sequencer)

MIDI-CV converters:
- Mono
- Poly

Meta-modes:
- MIDI Learn: receive channels
- MIDI Learn: DFAM note mapping


############################
### EEPROM / Saving State:

Settings that should be saved to EEPROM:
	- Midi mode (mono/poly)
	- Midi channels
	- Trigger lengths A and B
	- Cv calibration data A and B

############################
### TO INVESTIGATE: 

- Mode switch sometimes does not update the LED?
- Is 7.2kHz a good PWM frequency?


- MIDI spec: "voices dynamically allocated (notes/drums can re-attack using free voices)"
			 "Key-based Percussion is always on channel 10"
   also ->  CC 121 "Reset all Controllers"
		-> RPN (Registered Parameter Numbers)

############################
### SETTINGS/CONFIG

- Midi channels: one for outA, one for outB, one for keyboard mode
- Velocity sensitivity?
- MIDI root note?
- Note mapping for KCS mode




DAC Resolution...
=================

2^12 == 4096 codes, aka bits of resolution.

piano range == 88 semitones == 8800 cents in a piano
