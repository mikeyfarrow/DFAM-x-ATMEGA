NOTES, TODO, and IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
=======================================

# DAC4822

- Bypass capacitors:
   - V+ to ground -> 10μF tant, 0.1μF ceramic
   - Output (both) -> 1μF ? The tested range for stability is .001μF through 4.7 μF

- Gain setting:
   - If G = 1 is selected, the V_REF is 2.048V and has 500 μV of resolution
     If G = 2 is selected, the V_REF is 4.096V and has 1 mV of resolution
	 
- Talking to the MCU:
	- Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) details in datasheet
	- TODO: does the current code block in that while loop?
