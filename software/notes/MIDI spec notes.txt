MIDI SPEC NOTES
---------------

Some cool features that are implemented:

- Portamento
   - ctrls: portamento time

- Vibrato
   - ctrls: depth, rate, and delay

   - technical considerations:   
      - musical ranges for vibrato speed? and depth?
      - how often does DAC need to update the pitch for it to sound smooth?
   
- Pitch bend
   - RPN for depth? depth needs to be tuned from current setting... it is jumpy
      - possible to "slide" up/down to the new pitch bend value?
        --> don't think so, prob not how others implement this... hmmm...
